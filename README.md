# To Do List  

This full-stack web app keeps track of everything you need to do in a handy to do list. Use the form to add something to the list. Once added, you can click the "to do" item to mark it complete or click the trash can to delete it. The list also keeps track of the number of things you have left to do.

Toggle between light, dark and auto theme using the drop down menu at the bottom right hand corner.
